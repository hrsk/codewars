//DESCRIPTION:

//Your boss decided to save money by purchasing some cut-rate optical character
// recognition software for scanning in the text of old novels to your database.
// At first it seems to capture words okay,
// but you quickly notice that it throws in a lot of numbers at random places in the text.

//EXAMPLES:

//'! !'                 -> '! !'
// '123456789'           -> ''
// 'This looks5 grea8t!' -> 'This looks great!'

//SOLUTION:
//Your harried co-workers are looking to you for a solution to take this garbled text
// and remove all of the numbers. Your program will take in a string
// and clean out all numeric characters,
// and return a string with spacing and special characters ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,? all intact.

//SOLUTION:

function stringClean(s){
    const reg = new RegExp(/^\d+$/);
    // Function will return the cleaned string
    return s.split("").map((value) => value.replace(reg, "")).join("")
}

console.log(stringClean("!   !")) // "!   !"
console.log(stringClean("123456789")) // ""
console.log(stringClean("This looks5 grea8t!")) // This looks great!
